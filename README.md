# combuild-recipe-book
Team building exercise Step 2 in our own Hackathon.

## Non-Devs

GitHub is a tool which encourages collaboration and innovation. Open Source works due to collaboration and many eyes on the code. It is also about community. To encourage a sense of community within our larger team, please choose a recipe and add it as a markdown file (.md). You don't have to leave your  browser to do this!

- Step 1: You are on your way to becoming a GitHub Guru! Choose to Fork this repository.
- Step 2: After forking and opening online with (Codespaces). Again copy the lastname_firstname folder and rename with your name.
There is a recipe template but feel free to make it your own format. This can be a food recipe, food for building community, food for surviving the warming world, or not even food, recipe for teambuilding, etc. 
Optional upload a picture of the food, your self, a avatar or anything relating to your recipe. 
- When you are happy with your recipe, you will be ready to commit the changes to the repository.
- Now create a Pull Request to merge your changes back to the original owner's repository.
I will review the PR and add a card to the recipe book.
