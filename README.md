# combuild-recipe-book
Team building exercise Step 2 in our own Hackathon.

GitHub is a tool which encourages collaboration and innovation. Open Source works due to collaboration and many eyes on the code. It is also about community. To encourage a sense of community within our larger team, please choose a recipe and add it as a markdown file (.md). You don't have to leave your  browser to do this!

- Step 1: You are on your way to becoming a GitHub Guru! Navigate here https://github.com/kastone/combuild-recipe-book. Choose to Fork this repository. Hint: there is a button to fork the repo at the top right of the main repository screen.
  
- Step 2: After forking the repository ensure you are looking at your own copy of the forked repo. 
  
- Step 3: From the top level of the repo, choose "Add File" -> Create File. Type your lastName_firstName and then type a forward slash. You should see that a directory was created and it is waiting for the file name. Type recipe.md

- Step 4:In a new browser window navigate here: https://github.com/kastone/combuild-recipe-book/blob/main/recipe-template.md. Copy the contents of the recipe template and paste into your new file.
Edit the template. This can be a food recipe, food for building community, food for surviving the warming world, or not even food, recipe for teambuilding, etc. 
Optional: upload a picture of the food, your self, a avatar or anything relating to your recipe. To do this, make sure the pic is around 200px by 200px (jpg or png) and simple drag the photo from your local computer file manager into the edit view of the recipe.md file.

- Step 5: Choose to preview the .md file with the preview tab at the top.
- 
- Step 6: When you are happy with your recipe, you will be ready to commit the changes to the repository using the Green 'Commit changes' button. Click the commit button and enter a good commit message, then choose 'Commit Message'.

-Step 7: Create a pull request. (Grab me if you need help with this step!)
I will approve it and it will be merged back into the project.
