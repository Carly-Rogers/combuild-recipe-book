# Pandemic cookies
I tried the usual pandemic recipes with varying success.

- Sourdough bread (total failure, like a doorstop)
- Carbonara noodles (big success)
- New York Times fancy Tomato sandwich (Best thing I've discovered in years) https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017666-tomato-sandwiches
- Elderberry syrup (never used, still in fridge)
- David Chang's Momofuku Bossam - I did something wrong, like eating a block of salt.
- Vegan pb and chocolate cake.

## Notes
These lazy chocolate chip cookies became a Friday night (then Monday, Wednesday, Saturday) staple.
They helped my family find a little joy in Covid years.

## Ingredients
1 package of cookie dough.

## Tools
Oven or toaster oven
Cookie Sheet
Parchment Paper (optional)
#Method
Preheat oven to 350 and place dough squares on parchment paper lined cookie sheet.

Cook for 13-14 min.

## Tips
Eat immediately while cookies are still warm, while binge watching anything Marvel, Community, Parks and Rec, Shadow and Bone, His Dark Materials, 30 Rock or the Flash.
